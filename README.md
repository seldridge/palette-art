# Palette Art

Experiments in color, forked from sagemintblue/palette-art.

Displays swatches of all the currently available colorbrewer color
patterns. Just run the include latex/Makefile and it will fetch the
most recent version from the colorbrewer website and generate a pdf of
all the swatches. The names of the colors are listed at the top. To
use this in LaTeX, include the colorbrewer.tex file and reference the
associated colors.
